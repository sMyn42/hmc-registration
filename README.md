# HMC Registration Tool

### Purpose

The purpose of the HMC Registration Tool is to take a series of school-separated role request forms and create committee assignments.

### Data Format

The data should be school separated, and the name should contain, somewhere, the ranking of the school in the submission order (for preferential committee placement).

Otherwise, the files should have proper creation metadata.

### Usage

Simply place the ```main.py``` script in the base directory. Ensure that new role requests get placed in the ```pending-role-requests``` folder.

Then, run the script in the command line. A new spreadsheet should be created in the results folder with desired placements.
